This repository contains 2 folders to be used to manage your final project assignment. 

The APP folder is where you should commit all the code for your web application. 

The DUMP folder should contain the database .dump file required to re-create your database and ALL of it's data. 

NOTES ON CODE DEPENDENCIES 
- you need nodejs, react and express to run the code. This mean downloading build, node_module folders, package.json and other files that are needed to start up a react environment with a backend. Also note a proxy was used to connect the backend to the frontend
- Don't hesitate to conect us at: lwrigh89@uwo.ca if you have any concerns
